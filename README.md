# PrimeFactors and PrimeCheck

## Follow these steps:

- Write a program that determines if a number entered by a user is a prime
number.

- Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.

- Then calculate if the number is prime (i.e. it only has factors of 1 and itself).

- Finally, print out the number and state whether or not it is a prime
number.
